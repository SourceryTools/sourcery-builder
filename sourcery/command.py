    specified by the release config, to make sure that the build is
    reproducible from the specified sources.  Those commands set
    check_script to True, meaning that the script automatically
    re-execs itself using the correct script and Python interpreter,
    and with user site packages disabled, after reading the release
    config.  Other commands do not need this (although using the

    is necessary to use a separate copy of the script to bootstrap the
    checked-out copy of the scripts.
