# The disabled checks are those that are, empirically, unsuitable for
# Sourcery Builder (typically because of the size or complexity of
# some of the code).  Note that pycodestyle --ignore= means that only
# those checks are disabled, so some disabled-by-default checks may
# thereby be enabled.  A few pylint checks that seem appropriate
# generally but inappropriate in particular cases are disabled with
# "pylint: disable=" comments within the source.  It is possible that,
# as the code grows, more checks should be added to the set disabled
# here.
